# PokeDex

## PokeDex Guide
#### Hi! Let me explain how the Pokedex works. It's brief.

-When you open it, search for the Pokémon by its ID (e.g., 111), then press the yellow button below the keypad, and it will show you the information.
-To see the sprites, use the left and right arrows.

-To see the evolutions, use the up and down arrows.

-To delete and search for another Pokémon, press the large black button below the screen where the Pokémon is displayed.

-NOTE: Some Pokémon may not have sprites, which will appear as an error image. However, it's not a code error; it's because the API doesn't have the sprite, just in case.
